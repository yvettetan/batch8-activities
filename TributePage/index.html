            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Saoirse Una Ronan is an Irish actress born on April 12, 1994 and is best-known for her roles in The
                Lovely Bones,
                Brooklyn, Lady Bird and the recent adaptation of Little Women. At the age of 26, she has won a Golden
                Globe
                and is the second youngest
                actress to receive 4 Academy Award nominations. Aside from her works as a movie
                actress, Saoirse is
                also an ambassador for the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and is associated
                with Home Sweet Home, an anti-homeless campaign, in 2016.</p><br>

                    Interview from Vogue Magazine by Sally Rooney</span>
                <br>Saoirse Ronan on Growing Up on Camera, the Changing Politics of Ireland,
                and Becoming a Queen
            </h2>
            <h4><em>An Old Soul</em></h4>
            <p> Gradually the wind grows cold and clouds draw a white film over the horizon. Ronan suggests we walk back
                to her place for tea. On the way, she tells me how protective she’s become toward young people in her
                industry—people like “Timmy,” the actor Timothée Chalamet, the star of Guadagnino’s Call Me by Your
                Name, who also appeared in Lady Bird and is roughly one year her junior. I point out that Ronan herself
                is still young. “I know,” she says, catching herself. “I’ll talk about other people like that.” It’s not
                just that she sees herself as an industry veteran. “I’ve never felt young,” she tells me. At thirteen,
                she worked alongside the actor Guy Pearce on a movie called Death Defying Acts; when they were reunited
                on Mary Queen of Scots he told her, “You’re the same as you were when you were thirteen.” Other
                colleagues and friends agree. Margot Robbie, who plays Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots, describes her
                as “beyond her years”; Tóibín tells me she is “very, very sensible—she’s got an old head, an old soul.”
            </p>

            <h4><em>On Political Issues</em></h4>
            <p>I ask if Ronan ever worried about facing a backlash for speaking her mind on abortion, long
                considered a particularly divisive issue in Ireland. “I just felt like that wasn’t important,” she says.
                “I know people who had to travel abroad in order to get an abortion, and that’s when I knew I would
                speak out.” But Ronan doesn’t engage only with policy concerns that touch her life directly. She also
                voiced her support in 2016 for the illegal takeover of an empty building in Dublin’s city center to
                accommodate the homeless; and she takes the time to recommend me Jeff Chang’s We Gon’ Be Alright, a book
                of essays on racial resegregation in the U.S. “I wouldn’t say I grew up politically minded,” she tells
                me, “but the older I get, the more in touch I am with what activists are doing—and the more I want to
                help them.”</p><br>
